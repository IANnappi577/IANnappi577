Hello, my name is Ian, I am an aspiring software developer studying Computer Science.

I am currently interested in the fields of Systems Programming, Cybersecurity, and Cryptography. I have intermediate knowledge in full-stack, test-driven development, networking, cloud computing through AWS, computer graphics with WebGL (a direct OpenGL derivative), and Linux-based Operating Systems (C and RISC-V). I placed 779th in the <a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/">National Cyber League (NCL) Competition</a> for the Fall 2024 season. I am also studying a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with ArcGIS Pro.

- Preferred Operating Systems: Linux, UNIX
- Programming Languages (in descending familiarity): Java, C, Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript/Typescript, the RISC-V ISA, SQLite/mySQL, C++, Perl, Rust
- Libraries/Toolsets worked with: Git, AWS Management Console and CLI, VSCode, vim, ThreeJS, WebGL, ArcGIS Pro

This github contains my classwork and personal projects.
